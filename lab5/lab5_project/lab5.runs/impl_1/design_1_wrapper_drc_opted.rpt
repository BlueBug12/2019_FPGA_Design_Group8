REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 design_1_i/mem256X8_0/inst/mem_reg has an input control pin design_1_i/mem256X8_0/inst/mem_reg/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: design_1_i/mem256X8_0/inst/address[6]) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/processor_0/inst/addr_reg[6]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
